# Borderlands 2 Scripts
This repo contains some util scripts that can run over your **Borderlands 2** game that will help you to save some time.<br>
To make the scripts work, you may need to edit them to fit your preferences.

## Leave Game
A Script that makes you return to the title screen with the press of a single button.<br>
This may help you to do a faster farming during your gaming hours.<br>
Now you can go to the title screen just by pressing **F5**. The script will stop when you press **F6**.

## Contributing

I also accept any form of contribution, since i am a newbie.
